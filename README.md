<h1> Welcome to my Weather Messager! </h1>

<h2> <u>Requirements to set up:</u> </h2>

You need to sign up at Twilio and get an API key to use in the app and get a free number.
Note: The SMS and MMS will all begin with a "Sent from your Twilio trial account - " if you
have a trial account. You can pay for the service to get rid of this.

You will also need to get an API key from Dark Sky as well to use the app.

Finally, you will need the latitude and longitude of whatever city you are interested in getting forecasted.

<h2> What the app does! </h2>
The app sends you an MMS message if you want a weekly forecast. It sends you a SMS message if you want a current forecast.
